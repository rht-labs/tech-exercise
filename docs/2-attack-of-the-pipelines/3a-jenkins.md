### Jenkins Pipeline

> Jenkins is a tool that's been around for some time but it's stuck with a lot of customers. It's a build server that's pretty dumb by nature but can be enhanced with lots of plugins and agents which is why it's such a powerful tool.

#### Jenkins access to GitLab
Jenkins needs to access repositories to see Jenkinsfile. There are multiple options to use ie username/password, SSH Keys and token (which we will going to use)

1. Login to GitLab and click on your avatar from upper left corner > Settings.
![gitlab-settings](images/gitlav-settings.png)
2. Click on Access Token and generate one.
![gitlab-access-token](images/gitlab-access-token.png)
3. Copy the newly generated token and update `ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml`
![gitlab-access-token-2](images/gitlab-access-token-2.png)

```bash
...
...
          - name: GITLAB_TOKEN
            value: ''
...
```

```bash
git add ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml
git commit -m "ü•î Gitlab Token is added ü•î"
git push
```

#### Setup Pet Battle (frontend) GitLab Project

1. Open the GitLab UI. Create a Project in GitLab under `<TEAM_NAME>` group called `pet-battle`. Make the project as **public**.

    ![pet-battle-git-repo](images/pet-battle-git-repo.png)

2. Back in your CodeReady Workspace, we'll fork the PetBattle frontend code to this newly created repository on git.

    ```bash#test
    cd /projects
    git clone https://github.com/rht-labs/pet-battle.git && cd pet-battle
    git remote set-url origin https://${GIT_SERVER}/${TEAM_NAME}/pet-battle.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    <p class="warn">
        ‚õ∑Ô∏è <b>NOTE</b> ‚õ∑Ô∏è - If pet-battle folder is not appearing on the left hand side, you need to add it to your workspace manually as follows: 
    </p>

    Click the hamburger menu on the top left, then `File > Add Folder to Workspace`
    ![add-workspace-pet-battle](./images/add-workspace-pet-battle.png)

    Select `pet-battle` from the list and click `OK`.
    ![add-workspace-pet-battle-2](./images/add-workspace-pet-battle-2.png)

    _If the page refreshes after your selection, just reopen the terminal by hitting the hamburger menu on the top left then select `Terminal > New Terminal` from the menu._


3. We want to be able to tell Jenkins to run a build for every code change - welcome our good ol' friend the Webhook. Just like we did with Argo CD earlier, let's add a webhook to GitLab for our Pet Battle frontend so every commit triggers it. Jenkins needs a URL of the form `<JENKINS_URL>/multibranch-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=<APP_NAME>` to trigger a build:

    ```bash#test
    echo "https://$(oc get route jenkins --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd)/multibranch-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=pet-battle"
    ```

    Once you have the URL, over on GitLab go to `pet-battle > Settings > Integrations` to add the webhook:
    ![gitlab-webhook-trigger-fe.png](./images/gitlab-webhook-trigger-fe.png)

#### Jenkins Pipeline
> Jenkins is preloaded with a simple job called a `seed-multibranch-pipeline`. This is a small bit of groovy scripting that will automatically scaffold out our pipelines from each repositories `Jenkinsfile`. The logic of this script is simple; it checks a group for a given GitLab instance for any projects that contain a Jenkinsfile. If it finds one, it will scaffold a pipeline from it, and if not, it will skip.

1. To get the `seed-multibranch-pipeline` job to work we simply have to connect Jenkins to GitLab by exposing some variables on the deployment for it... we could, of course, just add them to the deployment in OpenShift BUTTTTTT this is GITOPS! :muscle: :gun:

    Update the `ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml` Jenkins block / values to match with the following:

    ```yaml
          #... more jenkins configuration here
          deployment:
            env_vars:
              - name: GITLAB_DEFAULT_BRANCH
                value: 'main'
              - name: GITLAB_HOST
                value: '<GIT_SERVER>'
              - name: GITLAB_GROUP_NAME
                value: '<TEAM_NAME>'
              - name: BISCUITS
                value: 'jaffa-cakesüç™'
    ```

    You can also run this bit of code to do the replacement if you are feeling uber lazy!

    ```bash#test
    yq e '(.applications[] | (select(.name=="jenkins").values.deployment.env_vars[] | select(.name=="GITLAB_HOST")).value)|=env(GIT_SERVER)' -i /projects/tech-exercise/ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml
    yq e '(.applications[] | (select(.name=="jenkins").values.deployment.env_vars[] | select(.name=="GITLAB_GROUP_NAME")).value)|=env(TEAM_NAME)' -i /projects/tech-exercise/ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml
    ```

2. Jenkins will push changes to our Helm chart to Nexus as part of the pipeline. Previously, we configured our App of Apps to pull from the PetBattle public chart repository, so we also need to update it. Change the `pet-battle/test/values.yaml` file to point to the Nexus chart repository deployed in OpenShift. To do this, update the `source` as shown below for the `pet-battle`:

    <div class="highlight" style="background: #f7f7f7">
    <pre><code class="language-yaml">
    # Pet Battle Apps
    pet-battle-api:
        ...
    pet-battle:
        name: pet-battle
        enabled: true
        source: http://nexus:8081/repository/helm-charts #<- update this
        source_ref: 1.0.6 # helm chart version
        ...
    </code></pre></div>

    Then, do the same thing for `pet-battle/stage/values.yaml` file as well.

    You can also run this bit of code to do the replacement if you are feeling uber lazy!

    ```bash#test
    yq e '.applications.pet-battle.source |="http://nexus:8081/repository/helm-charts"' -i /projects/tech-exercise/pet-battle/test/values.yaml
    ```

3. Commit these changes to git so Argo CD can sync them.

    ```bash#test
    cd /projects/tech-exercise
    git add .
    git commit -m  "üçï ADD - jenkins pipelines config üçï"
    git push
    ```

4. When this change rolls out we should see the seed job has scaffolded out a pipeline for the frontend in the Jenkins UI. It's done this by looking in the pet-battle repo where it found the `Jenkinsfile` (our pipeline definition). However, it will fail on the first execution. This is expected and we're going to write some stuff to fix it!

    ```bash#test
    # to get the Jenkins route on your terminal
    echo https://$(oc get route jenkins --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd)
    ```

    ![jenkins-ui](images/jenkins-ui.png)

    <p class="warn"><b>INFO</b> - If you do not see the job run after Jenkins restarts, feel free to manually trigger it to get it going.</p>


5. With Jenkins now scanning our GitLab project for new repositories and git setup to trigger a build on Jenkins, let's explore our pipeline! A `Jenkinsfile` uses a DSL (Jenkins language) to declaratively describe the pipeline in a series of blocks. Ours is setup a lot like this :

    ![jenkins-pipe](images/jenkins-pipe.png)

    Some of the key things to note above are:
    * `pipeline {}` is how all declarative Jenkins pipelines begin.
    * `environment {}` defines environment variables to be used across all build stages.
    * `options {}` contains specific Job specs you want to run globally across the jobs, e.g., setting the terminal colour.
    * `stage {}` all jobs must have one stage. This is the logical part of the build that will be executed, e.g., `bake-image`.
    * `steps {}` each `stage` has one or more steps involved. These could be execute shell script, git checkout, etc.
    * `agent {}` specifies the node the build should be run on, e.g., `jenkins-agent-npm`.
    * `post {}` hook is used to specify the post-build-actions. Jenkins declarative pipeline syntax provides very useful callbacks for `success`, `failure` and `always` which are useful for controlling the job flow.
    * `when {}` is used for flow control. It can be used at the stage level and be used to stop pipeline entering that stage. For example, when the branch is master, then deploy to `test` environment.

6. Now that we've gone through what this stuff does, let's try to fix the failing build. If you look at the output of the Jenkins job, you'll see it's not able to find anything in Nexus to put in a container. To fix this, update the `Jenkinsfile` by adding a new `stage` which will run app compilation, producing the artifact in Nexus for us. Add the following below to the  `// üí•üî® PIPELINE EXERCISE GOES HERE ` comment:

    ```groovy
            // üí•üî® PIPELINE EXERCISE GOES HERE
            stage("üß∞ Build (Compile App)") {
                agent { label "jenkins-agent-npm" }
                options {
                  skipDefaultCheckout(true)
                }
                steps {
                    sh '''
                    git clone ${GIT_URL} pet-battle && cd pet-battle
                    git checkout ${BRANCH_NAME}
                    '''
                    dir('pet-battle'){

                    script {
                        env.VERSION = sh(returnStdout: true, script: "npm run version --silent").trim()
                        env.PACKAGE = "${APP_NAME}-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
                    }
                    sh 'printenv'

                    echo '### Install deps ###'
                    sh 'npm ci --registry http://nexus:8081/repository/labs-npm'

                    // üíÖ Lint exercise here
                    echo '### Running Linting ###'

                    // üÉè Jest Testing
                    echo '### Running Jest Testing ###'

                    echo '### Running build ###'
                    sh 'npm run build '

                    // üåû SONARQUBE SCANNING EXERCISE GOES HERE
                    echo '### Running SonarQube ###'

                    echo '### Packaging App for Nexus ###'
                    sh '''
                        tar -zcvf ${PACKAGE} dist Dockerfile nginx.conf
                        curl -v -f -u ${NEXUS_CREDS} --upload-file ${PACKAGE} \
                            http://nexus:8081/repository/${NEXUS_REPO_NAME}/${APP_NAME}/${PACKAGE}
                    '''
                  }
                }
                // üì∞ Post steps go here
            }
    ```

    You can also run this bit of code to do the replacement if you are feeling uber lazy!

    ```bash#test
    wget -O /projects/pet-battle/Jenkinsfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs/tech-exercise/main/tests/doc-regression-test-files/3a-jenkins-Jenkinsfile.groovy
    ```

7. Push the changes to git.

    ```bash#test
    cd /projects/pet-battle
    git add Jenkinsfile
    git commit -m "üå∏ Jenkinsfile updated with build stage üå∏"
    git push
    ```

8. Back in Jenkins we should now see the pipeline is running. If you swap to the Blue Ocean view, you get a lovely graph of what it looks like in execution.
