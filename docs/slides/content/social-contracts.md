The Social Contract is a simple, yet highly effective manner to enable team autonomy and self accountability for engagements.<!--{.element: style="font-size: ; font-weight: 400!important;"} -->

A Social Contract codifies behavior and expectations for the team members.<!--{.element: style="font-size: ; font-weight: 400!important;"} -->



#### Effective Social Contracts Are
- Publicly displayed
- Revisited regularly and amended if required
- Binding on *all* parties
- Signatories hold each other accountable



#### _Why use it?_
* Provides a quick means to determine team dynamics and expectations
* Promotes autonomy and self-governing of team behavior
* Keeps the team consciously aware of how they work together
* Establishes empathy and context for future conversations between team members
* Enables psychological safety within the group



#### _How do we do it?_
1) Individually, write down your expectations about working together.
    * Think about behaviors exhibited by really great teams that you've worked with.
    * Consider the behaviors of any terrible teams that you've worked with.
3) Together, review and group the behaviors.
5) After reaching consensus, sign the contract.
6) Display the contract in a visible place.
7) Establish your team name (naming things is hard).
<br/>

If you work on multiple teams, think about the aspects of your Social Contract that are appropriate for the entire group so you can write the group social contract.<!--{.element: style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 600!important;"} -->

    - Discuss how you want to work together this week
    - Write your Social Contract
    - Record your team button
</br></br>

* Timebox debates
* Celebrate success!

#### Facilitation Tips
Ensure that things in the Social Contract are actionable. For example  "Be Open" has good intent, but lacks specificity. Ask questions to tease our greater meanings.
</br>

_"Can you give me an example of not being open?" can lead to actionable items like "Listen to others as I would like to be heard" or "Give space to the quiet person"._ <!--{.element: style="font-size: ; font-weight: 300!important;"} -->
