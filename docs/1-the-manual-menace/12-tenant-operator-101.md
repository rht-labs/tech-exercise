# 🐓 Tenant Operator 101

Stakater’s [Tenant-Operator](https://docs.cloud.stakater.com/content/sre/tenant-operator/overview.html) makes it easy to implement multi-tenancy in your organisation. When you create a tenant, you get a dedicated SAAP instance.
Network and Security Policies, Resource Quotas, Limit Ranges, and RBAC policies which are configured for a tenant, are inherited by all the namespaces and users of that tenant.

With Tenant-Operator custom resources, you can help your developers self-service, reliving your admins of some engineering toil.

Your Tenant Operator can configure the following custom resources;

- Tenants
- Quotas
- Templates for your application deployments
- ResourceSupervisor
- Namespaces

Tenant-Operator resources is designed 100% cloud-native, this means that you can manage your tenants as code allowing you to integrate Gitops best practices into your multi-tenancy workflow.

## Creating Tentants with Gitop

The following [Repository](https://gitlab.apps.devtest.vxdqgl7u.kubeapp.cloud/my-group/nordmart-gitops-config) contains ArgoCD app configurations to help automate the creation of your tenant.

1. From the repository, click on the `workshop` folder.

4. Paste the code below to create a new tenant with a user, a list of argoCD “watched” repositories belonging to the tenant and its accompanying namespaces.

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: <INSERT_YOUR_TENANT_NAME>
spec:
  quota: workshop-medium
  owners:
    users:
      - <INSERT_YOUR_USER_NAME>
  argocd:
    sourceRepos:
      - 'https://gitlab.apps.devtest.vxdqgl7u.kubeapp.cloud/dominators/workshop-infra-gitops-config.git'
      - 'https://gitlab.apps.devtest.vxdqgl7u.kubeapp.cloud/genesis/nordmart-apps-gitops-config.git'
      - 'https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts'
  namespaces:
  - dev
  - build
  - test
  - prod
```

5. Add a usefull commit message indicating the changes you wish to make. In the `Target Branch` tile, input ypur branch name and select `commit changes` to create a merge request.
