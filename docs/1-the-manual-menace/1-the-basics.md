## 🐌 The Basics - CRW, OCP & Helm
## CodeReady Workspaces setup

1. Login to your CodeReadyWorkspace (CRW) Editor. The link to this will be provided by your instructor.

<p class="warn">
If the workspace has not been set up for you, you can create one from this devfile. On CodeReady Workspaces, "Create Workspace > Custom Workspace". Enter this URL to load the DO500 stack:</br>
<span style="color:blue;"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs/enablement-framework/main/codereadyworkspaces/do500-devfile.yaml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs/enablement-framework/main/codereadyworkspaces/do500-devfile.yaml</a><span>
</p>

2. In your IDE (it may take some time to open ... ⏰☕️), open a new terminal by hitting `Terminal > Open Terminal in Specific Container > stack-do500` from the menu.

3. <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> - if you want to use `zsh` as opposed to `sh`, you can set it as the default shell by running. `zsh` is swish has neat shortcuts and plugins plus all the cool kids are using it 😎!
```bash
echo "exec zsh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

4. Setup your `TEAM_NAME` name in the environment of the CodeReadyWorkspace by running the command below. We will use the `TEAM_NAME` variable throughout the exercises so having it stored in our session means less changing of this variable throughout the exercises 💪. Ensure your `TEAM_NAME` is spelt with lower case characters and without any spaces in the name:
```bash
echo export TEAM_NAME="<TEAM_NAME>" | tee -a ~/.bashrc -a ~/.zshrc
```

5. Add the `CLUSTER_DOMAIN` to the environment:
```bash
echo export CLUSTER_DOMAIN="<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>" | tee -a ~/.bashrc -a ~/.zshrc
```

6. Add the `GIT_SERVER` to the environment:
```bash
echo export GIT_SERVER="<GIT_SERVER>" | tee -a ~/.bashrc -a ~/.zshrc
```

7. Verify the variables you have set:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
echo ${TEAM_NAME}
echo ${CLUSTER_DOMAIN}
echo ${GIT_SERVER}
```

8. Check if you can connect to OpenShift. Run the command below. 
```bash
oc login --server=https://api.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN##apps.}:6443 -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD>
```

9. Check your user permissions in OpenShift by creating your team's `ci-cd` project. 
```bash
oc new-project ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd
```

### Helm 101
> Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. It provides a way to templatise the Kubernetes YAML that make up our application. The Kubernetes resources such as `DeploymentConfig`, `Route` & `Service` can be processed by supplying `values` to the templates. In Helm land, there are a few ways to do this. A package containing the templates and their default values is called a `chart`. 

Let's deploy a simple application using Helm.

1. Helm charts are packaged and stored in repositories. They can be added as dependencies of other charts or used directly. Let's add a chart repository now. The chart repository stores version history of our charts as well as the tar file the chart is packaged as.
```bash
helm repo add do500 https://rht-labs.com/todolist/
```

2. Let's install a chart from this repo. First search the repositories to see what is available, then install the latest version. Helm likes to give each install a release, for convenience we've set ours to `my`. This will add a prefix of `my-` to all the resources that are created.
```bash
helm search repo todolist
```
```bash
helm install my do500/todolist --namespace ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd
```

3. Open the application up in the browser to verify it's up and running. Here's a handy one-liner to get the address of the app
```bash
echo https://$(oc get route/my-todolist -n ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd --template='{{.spec.host}}')
```

4.  You can overwrite the default <span style="color:blue;">[values](https://github.com/rht-labs/todolist/blob/master/chart/values.yaml)</span> in a chart from the command line. Let's upgrade our deployment to show this. We'll make a simple change to the values. By default, we only have one replica of our application, let's use helm to set this to 5.
```bash
oc get pods -n ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd
```
```bash
helm upgrade my do500/todolist --set replicas=5 --namespace ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd
```
```bash
oc get pods -n ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd
```

5. If you're done playing with the #amazing-todolist-app then let's tidy up our work by removing the chart. To do this, run helm uninstall to remove our release of the chart.
```bash
helm uninstall my --namespace ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd
```
verify the clean up
```bash
oc get pods -n ${TEAM_NAME}-ci-cd | grep todolist
```

6. For those who are really interested, this is the anatomy of our Helm chart. It can be <span style="color:blue;">[found here](https://github.com/rht-labs/todolist)</span>, but the basic structure is as follows:
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f7f7f7">
<pre><code class="language-bash">
todolist/chart
├── Chart.yaml
├── templates
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── deploymentconfig.yaml
│   ├── route.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
└── values.yaml
</code></pre></div>
where:
* `Chart.yaml` - is the manifest of the chart. It defines the name, version and dependencies for our chart.
* `values.yaml` - is the sensible defaults for our chart to work, it contains the variables that are passed to the templates. We can over write these values on the command line.
* `templates/*.yaml` - they are our k8s resources. 
* `_helpers.tpl` - is a collection of reusable variables an yaml snippets that are applied across all of the k8s resources uniformly for example, labels are defined in here and included on each k8s resource file as necessary.

🪄🪄 Now, let's continue with even more exiting tool... !🪄🪄
