# Exercise 6 - SECRET MANAGEMENT 

In this section, we will walk through secret management workflow in SAAP. 

## Explain how MTO, Vault & ESO come together to serve Secrets Management (Secrets injection related setup configuration and workflow)

The detailed step by step diagram of MTO integrating with Vault and ESO.

When administrator creates Tenants in openshift cluster, Multi Tenant Operator (MTO) enables a KeyValue engine for the Tenant (same as tenant name) and it create groups, roles and policies required for tenant users inside Vault. In addition, Multi Tenant Operator (MTO) creates necessary roles with tenant users against vault client in RHSSO.

All of this is Automated Thanks to MTO !!

1. To access Vault from  [Forecastle](https://forecastle-stakater-forecastle.apps.devtest.vxdqgl7u.kubeapp.cloud) console, click on the `Vault` tile.

2. From the drop-down menu under `Method`, select `OIDC` and click on `Sign in with OIDC Provider` and select `workshop` identity Provider

> Note: It can take a few minutes for your tenants resources to be provisioned in Vault, if you have errors please inform the workshop leads. The most likely solution will be to give it some more time so lets proceed!

3. You will be brought to the `Vault` console. Upon creation of your tenant, a folder belonging to your tenant for holding your secrets is created as well.

Moreover, we can define templateInstance in Tenant CR, which can deploy SecretStore (pointing to KV path in Vault) in all tenant namespaces. Define `spec.templateInstances` in Tenant CR.

      templateInstances:
      - spec:
            template: tenant-vault-access
            sync: true

This `tenant-vault-access` deploys a service account and secret store. 

      apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
      kind: Template
      metadata:
      name: tenant-vault-access
      resources:
      manifests:
      - kind: ServiceAccount
         apiVersion: v1
         metadata:
            name: tenant-vault-access
            labels:
               stakater.com/vault-access: "true"
      - apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
         kind: SecretStore
         metadata:
            name: tenant-vault-secret-store
         spec:
            provider:
            vault:
               server: "http://vault.stakater-vault:8200"
               path: "${tenant}/kv"
               version: "v2"
               auth:
                  kubernetes:
                  mountPath: "kubernetes"
                  role: "${namespace}"
                  serviceAccountRef:
                     name: "tenant-vault-access"

Notice the label `stakater.com/vault-access: "true"`, Multi Tenant Operator creates roles for vault for this service account.
