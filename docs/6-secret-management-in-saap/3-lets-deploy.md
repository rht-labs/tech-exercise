# Lets deploy our application 

In this section, we will deploy the `Nordmart Review UI` Application. `Nordmart Review UI` is a light weight application for management of product reviews. This application also requires backend `Nordmart Review` which is already deployed in your Tenant. This application implements review functionality for the products; it provides CRUDS API for reviews.

1. You can view the application by Logging In to the cluster & opening `<TENANT_NAME>-dev` project from projects.

    --Add Image--

2. Navigate to routes and copy the route. 

    --Add Image--

    Alternatively, you can run the following command in your devspace terminal. 

        REVIEW_API=$(oc get route review --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n <TENANT>-dev)

3. Make a curl request on the URL copied in the previous step. You should get a similar response as below.

        curl http://$REVIEW_API:8080/api/review/329199

    --Add Image--
