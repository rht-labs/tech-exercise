## Slide Decks
Slide decks are now published alongside the tech exercise. The raw Markdown files for each of the tech exercise is in the same monorepo used by learners and facilitators. To add a new slide deck or update any existing ones, simply navigate to `docs/slides/content` and edit an existing file or create a new `.md` file. This will autogenerate the slide deck once published. You can view or edit the slides for testing by running the docsify server. See the GitHub repository for more information.

## 🪄 Customize The Instructions
The box at the top of the page allows you to load the docs with variables used by your team prefilled. All you have to do is fill in the boxes at the top of the page with your team's name in the box and the domain your cluster is using and hit `save`. This will persist the values in your local storage for the site, so hitting `clear` will reset these for you if you made a mistake.

* If my team is called `biscuits` then pop that in the first box. This value will be prefixed to some of the things such as the namespaces we use.
* For the cluster domain, you want to add the `apps.*` bit from the OpenShift domain. For example, if my console address lives at <code class="language-yaml">https://console-openshift-console.apps.hivec.sandbox1243.opentlc.com/</code>
 then just put `apps.hivec.sandbox1243.opentlc.com` in the box to generate the correct address for the exercises.
* For the git server, you could use your preferred and accessible Git server (GitHub, GitLab, ...). The instructor could provide you one.
For example, if the git server lives at <code class="language-yaml">https://gitlab-ce.apps.hivec.sandbox1243.opentlc.com/</code>, then just
put `gitlab-ce.apps.hivec.sandbox1243.opentlc.com`in the box to generate the correct address for the exercises.

## 🦆 Conventions
When running through the exercise, we've tried to call out where things need replacing. The key ones are anything inside an `<>` which should be replaced. For example, if your team is called `biscuits`, then if you see `\<TEAM_NAME\>` in the instructions, this should be replaced with `biscuits` like so:
    <div class="highlight" style="background: #f7f7f7">
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
    name: <\TEAM_NAME\>
    # ^ this becomes
    name: biscuits
    </code></pre></div>

There are lots of code blocks for you to copy and paste. They have little ✂️ icon on the right if you move your cursor on the code block. 
```bash
echo "like this one :)"
```
But there are also some blocks that you shouldn't copy and paste which don't have the copy✂️ icon. That means you should validate your outputs or YAML files against the given block.
