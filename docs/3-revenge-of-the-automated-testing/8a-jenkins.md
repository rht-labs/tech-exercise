## Extend Jenkins Pipeline with Image Signing

1. Add a new Jenkins agent with `cosign` command line in it. Open up `ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml` and under `Jenkins` add `jenkins-agent-cosign` to the list.

    ```yaml
            # default names, versions, repo and paths set on the template
            - name: jenkins-agent-npm
            - name: jenkins-agent-mvn
            - name: jenkins-agent-helm
            - name: jenkins-agent-argocd
            - name: jenkins-agent-cosign # add this one
    ```

    ```bash
    cd /projects/tech-exercise
    git add ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml
    git commit -m  "🔒 ADD - Cosign Jenkins Agent 🔒"
    git push
    ```

    <p class="warn">If you get an error like <b>error: failed to push some refs to..</b>, please run <b><i>git pull</i></b>, then push your changes again by running above commands.</p>    

2. Add a new stage into Jenkinsfile with cosign steps. Image signing should run after image build. Copy the below block into the right placeholder:

    ```groovy
            // 🔏 IMAGE SIGN EXAMPLE GOES HERE
            stage("🔏 Image Signing") {
                agent { label "jenkins-agent-cosign" }           
                options {
                        skipDefaultCheckout(true)
                }
                steps {
                    script {
                        sh '''
                        oc registry login
                        cosign sign --key k8s://<TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd/${TEAM_NAME}-cosign `oc registry info`/${DESTINATION_NAMESPACE}/${APP_NAME}:${VERSION} --allow-insecure-registry
                        '''
                    }
                }
            }
    ```

3. Store the public key in `pet-battle` repo for anyone who would like to verify our images, alongside the Jenkinsfile changes. This push will trigger a Jenkins job for build as well.

    ```bash
    cp /tmp/cosign.pub /projects/pet-battle/
    cd /projects/pet-battle
    git add cosign.pub Jenkinsfile
    git commit -m  "⛹️ ADD - cosign public key for image verification and Jenkinsfile updated ⛹️"
    git push
    ```

    🪄 Observe the **pet-battle** pipeline running with the **image-sign** stage.
    ![cosign-jenkins-pipeline](images/cosign-jenkins-pipeline.png)

    After the pipeline succesfully finish, in the `Administrator` view, go to OpenShift UI > Builds > ImageStreams inside `<TEAM_NAME>-test` namespace and select `pet-battle`. You'll see a tag ending with `.sig` which shows you that this is image signed.

    ![cosign-image-signing-pet-battle](images/cosign-image-signing-pet-battle.png)

4. Let's verify the signed image with the public key. Make sure you use the right `APP VERSION` for the image. (`1.2.0` in this case)

    ```bash
    cd /projects/pet-battle
    oc registry login $(oc registry info) --insecure=true
    cosign verify --key k8s://<TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd/<TEAM_NAME>-cosign default-route-openshift-image-registry.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>/<TEAM_NAME>-test/pet-battle:1.2.0 --allow-insecure-registry --insecure-ignore-tlog
    ```

    The output should be like:

    <div class="highlight" style="background: #f7f7f7">
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
    Verification for default-route-openshift-image-registry.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>/<TEAM_NAME>-test/pet-battle:1.2.0 --
    The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
    - The cosign claims were validated
    - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
    - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.

    </code></pre></div>
