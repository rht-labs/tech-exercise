### Deploy Zalenium (selenium grid for kube!)

> Zalenium is a flexible and scalable container based Selenium Grid with video recording, live preview, basic auth & dashboard.

1. To add Zalenium to our cluster, it's been packaged up as a helm chart. We can add this helm chart to our `values-tooling` file. Open this up in your Dev Spaces and add the configuration for `Zalenium` so our GitOps controller can pick it up and roll out the change 🐙

    ```yaml
      # Zalenium
      - name: zalenium
        enabled: true
        source: https://github.com/zalando/zalenium.git
        source_path: charts/zalenium
        source_ref: "master"
        values:
        hub:
            serviceType: ClusterIP
            openshift:
            route:
                enabled: true
            serviceAccount:
            create: false
            desiredContainers: 0
    ```

2. Commit the changes to see them reflected in ArgoCD

    ```bash#test
    cd /projects/tech-exercise
    git add .
    git commit -m  "🥒 ADD - Zalenium for testing 🥒"
    git push
    ```

3. Once Zalenium is installed, then create a route to access the Zalenium Dashboard:

    ```bash#test
    oc create route edge --service=svc/zalenium -n <TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd 
    oc label route zalenium rht-gitops.com/<TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd- -n <TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd
    oc get route/zalenium --template='{{.spec.host}}' -n <TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd
    ```
> The reason of running `oc label` is that when you create an OpenShift route using the `oc create route edge --service=<service-name>` command, it automatically inherits the labels from the specified service. This means that it adds the `rht-gitops.com/<TEAM_NAME>-ci-cd` label. This label makes ArgoCD to manage the resource and it gets deleted because is not part of the zalenium Helm chart.

### Add the System Tests to git and execute our pipeline

> An existing project containing some end to end tests and a corresponding Jenkinsfile have been created for you. They use JavaScript to execute. These tests are written in a BDD style syntax and are fairly basic but illustrative of what can be achieved with automated testing

![bdd-tests.png](images/bdd-tests.png)

1. Open GitLab and create a new project called `system-tests`. Make it *public* and ensure it's within your team name (`<TEAM_NAME>`) group (`ateam`  in the screenshot below)

    ![pgitlab-sys-tests](images/gitlab-sys-tests.png)


2. In your Dev Spaces, fork the upstream `system-tests` project and push it to the new GitLab project.

    ```bash#test
    cd /projects
    git clone https://github.com/petbattle/system-tests.git && cd system-tests
    git remote set-url origin https://${GIT_SERVER}/${TEAM_NAME}/system-tests.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

#### In your groups pick the tool you'd like to integrate the pipeline with:
